Learning how GitHub works
I am a sophomore at MNU learning about computer programming.
Here are the answers to the lab questions
i.	What is a branch? A section of a project that can be worked on and later become part of the master branch.
ii.	What is a commit? A change to a branch. It is recorded so that it can be removed if it caused an error or something.
iii.	What is the purpose of a pull request? To get feedback from others or just to show them your commit before it is added to the branch.
